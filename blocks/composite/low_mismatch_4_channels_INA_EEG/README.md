# Low Mismatch 4 Channels Instrumentation Amplifier for Electroencephalography (EEG) Measurement using LLM
This chip is a high-precision instrumentation amplifier array for multichannel EEG, utilizing group-chopping to cyclically route and average signals across amplifiers, effectively minimizing gain mismatch, input-referred offset, and low-frequency noise.
